# iso-rebuild

This is a bash script that can be used to customize or remaster a *buntu ISO file based on a configuration file and run-time arguments.

This is achieved by unpacking the squashfs from the specificed ISO file to your local filesystem, which is then set up as a chroot environment, in which packages are adding/removed based on a configuration file, and/or executing scripts throughout the process.

The inspiration for this comes from other utilities like remastersys, but did not suit my needs.


```bash
$ 


```
